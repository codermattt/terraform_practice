## About project
- simple project to create an ec2 instance with terraform
- each of the resources and configurations are configured in each of the files (sec-group, key-pair, instance.tf for instance details)
- the key-pair was generated off the command line in vscode (ssh-keygen) -> "arsenal-key", "test-key" was for experimentation
