## terraform_practice

## Overview
This repository contains Terraform configurations for managing infrastructure as code (IaC). Terraform enables declarative infrastructure management across various cloud providers.

## Prerequisites
Before using this Terraform project, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
- Cloud provider credentials (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP), to allow terraform to communicate with it


## Notes
- I setup the infrastructure on vscode, then run the terrafrom commands on git Bash terminal in vscode
- The different projects (set up in each excercise folder) build on top of each other
